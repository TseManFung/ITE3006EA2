                                <p>A highly skilled and happy-go-lucky Lycoris agent. She works at the LycoReco, a
                                    branch of Direct Attack (DA) that covers as a café serving both Western and Japanese
                                    sweets. Considered to be the agency's greatest agent in its history, Chisato can
                                    dodge bullets even at point blank range, a skill regarded as "superhuman". She uses
                                    a gun given to her when she was young by Yoshimatsu, a member of the Alan Institute,
                                    and loads it with rubber bullets. She possesses an artificial heart, provided by the
                                    Institute to extend her life. Due to sabotage on her heart after she refused to use
                                    her abilities to kill, her lifespan drops to around two months.</p>

                                <p>A serious and confident Lycoris agent, Takina possesses immense skills as a Lycoris
                                    agent, often going out of her way to complete missions on her own. After she
                                    indiscriminately fires at the enemies during an operation to intercept a firearms
                                    transaction in order to save a colleague, the agency dismisses her, as she ignored
                                    orders and compromised the lives of the other agents at the scene. The agency
                                    transfers her to LycoReco. Wanting to be reinstated, she cooperates with Chisato on
                                    managing the café, as well as on their missions.</p>

                                <p>A skilled hacker who goes under the code name "Walnut". She is first introduced
                                    wearing a squirrel suit. She is responsible for a hack of the DA's Radiata, an
                                    artificial intelligence regarded as being impenetrable. However, when her life
                                    becomes in danger due to competition from her rival "Robota", she requests security
                                    from LycoReco. After she was "killed" by mercenaries working under Robota, she
                                    starts living and working at LycoReco in exchange of support during LycoReco's
                                    missions. "Walnut" is actually the name of an artificial intelligence program she
                                    operates.</p>

                                <p>An Alan Institute child who was also seen as a genius for killing and serves as the
                                    main antagonist. Unlike Chisato, Majima becomes a terrorist, seeking for a "balance"
                                    in an otherwise peaceful world. He is involved in several terrorist incidents, most
                                    notably during the destruction of the old radio tower and an attack on a metro
                                    station, though both are covered up by DA. He works with the hacker Robota to expose
                                    DA to the public and took an interest with Chisato after their encounter at the old
                                    radio tower attack. As he was initially born blind, he has developed a strong sense
                                    of hearing, which he can use to recognize people and events.</p>

                                <p>An Afro-Japanese man who is the manager of LycoReco. He is seen by Chisato as a
                                    father figure, alongside Yoshimatsu. Like Yoshimatsu, he also saw Chisato as a
                                    weapon for killing, though he later underwent a change of heart. He is a former DA
                                    instructor who left the organization, though he still supports them through
                                    LycoReco.</p>

                                <p>A member of the Alan Institute. He sees Chisato as a weapon for killing, a vision he
                                    initially shared with Mika. He gave Chisato an artificial heart produced by the
                                    Institute, in hopes that she would become a skilled assassin. He frequently drops by
                                    LycoReco as a customer, though his identity is kept secret to Chisato until later in
                                    the series.</p>
